# Chest-XRay-Diagnosis
A medical image diagnosis by building a state-of-the-art chest X-ray classifier using Keras.

In particular we will:

Pre-process and prepare a real-world X-ray dataset
Use transfer learning to retrain a DenseNet model for X-ray image classification
Learn a technique to handle class imbalance
Measure diagnostic performance by computing the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve
Visualize model activity using GradCAMs


The model is trained for detecting the following medical conditions on a given Xray:
1.'Cardiomegaly' 

2.'Emphysema'

3.'Effusion'

4.'Hernia'

5.'Infiltration' 

6.'Mass'

7.'Nodule'

8.'Atelectasis'

9.'Pneumothorax'

10.'Pleural_Thickening' 

11.'Pneumonia' 

12.'Fibrosis' 

13.'Edema'

14.'Consolidation'
